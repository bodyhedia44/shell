Welcome to my implementation of a Unix-like shell This project is a deep dive into the inner workings of a command-line interface â€” building from scratch everything from command parsing to piping and redirection.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

This shell mimics the behavior of basic Unix shells like `bash` or `zsh`, providing a hands-on experience with:

* Process creation and management
* Argument parsing
* I/O redirection
* Pipes (`|`)
* Built-in commands (`cd`, `exit`, etc.)
